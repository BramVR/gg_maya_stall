# Maya Stall

Maya Stall is a Go CLI for real Autodesk Maya UI end-to-end checks from consuming repos.

## Check

```sh
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/maya-stall
```

## Start a consuming repo config

```sh
maya-stall init
```

`maya-stall init` writes `.maya-stall.yaml` with a repo-only sample smoke Scenario. Keep Host Credentials, Host Pools, SSH keys, hostnames, and private infrastructure details outside repo config.
